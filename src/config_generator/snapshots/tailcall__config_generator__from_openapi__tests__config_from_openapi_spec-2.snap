  A PaymentIntent guides you through the process of collecting a payment from your customer.
We recommend that you create exactly one PaymentIntent for each order or

A PaymentIntent transitions through
[multiple statuses](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/intents#intent-statuses)

  A SetupIntent guides you through the process of setting up and saving a customer's payment credentials for future payments.
For example, you can use a SetupIntent to set up and save your customer's card without immediately collecting a payment.
Later, you can use [PaymentIntents](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intents) to drive the payment flow.

Create a SetupIntent when you're ready to collect your customer's payment credentials.
Don't maintain long-lived, unconfirmed SetupIntents because they might not be valid.
The SetupIntent transitions through multiple [statuses](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/intents#intent-statuses) as it guides
you through the setup process.

Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future payments.
For example, cardholders in [certain regions](/guides/strong-customer-authentication) might need to be run through
[Strong Customer Authentication](https://stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication) during payment method collection
to streamline later [off-session payments](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/setup-intents).
If you use the SetupIntent with a [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#setup_intent_object-customer),
it automatically attaches the resulting payment method to that Customer after successful setup.
We recommend using SetupIntents or [setup_future_usage](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage) on
PaymentIntents to save payment methods to prevent saving invalid or unoptimized payment methods.

By using SetupIntents, you can reduce friction for your customers, even as regulations change over time.

  Possible values are `incomplete`, `incomplete_expired`, `trialing`, `active`, `past_due`, `canceled`, `unpaid`, or `paused`. 

For `collection_method=charge_automatically` a subscription moves into `incomplete` if the initial payment attempt fails. A subscription in this status can only have metadata and default_source updated. Once the first invoice is paid, the subscription moves into an `active` status. If the first invoice is not paid within 23 hours, the subscription transitions to `incomplete_expired`. This is a terminal status, the open invoice will be voided and no further invoices will be generated. 

A subscription that is currently in a trial period is `trialing` and moves to `active` when the trial period is over. 

A subscription can only enter a `paused` status [when a trial ends without a payment method](/billing/subscriptions/trials#create-free-trials-without-payment). A `paused` subscription doesn't generate invoices and can be resumed after your customer adds their payment method. The `paused` status is different from [pausing collection](/billing/subscriptions/pause-payment), which still generates invoices and leaves the subscription's status unchanged. 

If subscription `collection_method=charge_automatically`, it becomes `past_due` when payment is required but cannot be paid (due to failed payment or awaiting additional user actions). Once Stripe has exhausted all payment retry attempts, the subscription will become `canceled` or `unpaid` (depending on your subscriptions settings). 

If subscription `collection_method=send_invoice` it becomes `past_due` when its invoice is not paid by the due date, and `canceled` or `unpaid` if it is still not paid by an additional deadline after that. Note that when a subscription has a status of `unpaid`, no subsequent invoices will be attempted (invoices will be created, but then immediately automatically closed). After receiving updated payment information from a customer, you may choose to reopen and pay their closed invoices.
