Possible values are `incomplete`, `incomplete_expired`, `trialing`, `active`, `past_due`, `canceled`, `unpaid`, or `paused`. 

For `collection_method=charge_automatically` a subscription moves into `incomplete` if the initial payment attempt fails. A subscription in this status can only have metadata and default_source updated. Once the first invoice is paid, the subscription moves into an `active` status. If the first invoice is not paid within 23 hours, the subscription transitions to `incomplete_expired`. This is a terminal status, the open invoice will be voided and no further invoices will be generated. 

A subscription that is currently in a trial period is `trialing` and moves to `active` when the trial period is over. 

A subscription can only enter a `paused` status [when a trial ends without a payment method](/billing/subscriptions/trials#create-free-trials-without-payment). A `paused` subscription doesn't generate invoices and can be resumed after your customer adds their payment method. The `paused` status is different from [pausing collection](/billing/subscriptions/pause-payment), which still generates invoices and leaves the subscription's status unchanged.

Once Stripe has exhausted all payment retry attempts, the subscription will become `canceled` or `unpaid` (depending on your subscriptions settings). 

If subscription `collection_method=send_invoice` it becomes `past_due` when its invoice is not paid by the due date, and `canceled` or `unpaid` if it is still not paid by an additional deadline after that. Note that when a subscription has a status of `unpaid`, no subsequent invoices will be attempted (invoices will be created, but then immediately automatically closed).

  A PaymentIntent guides you through the process of collecting a payment from your customer.
We recommend that you create exactly one PaymentIntent for each order or

see the history of payment attempts for a particular session.

A PaymentIntent transitions through
[multiple statuses](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/intents#intent-statuses)

authentication flows and ultimately creates at most one successful charge.

  A SetupIntent guides you through the process of setting up and saving a customer's payment credentials for future payments.
For example, you can use a SetupIntent to set up and save your customer's card without immediately collecting a payment.
Later, you can use [PaymentIntents](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intents) to drive the payment flow.

Create a SetupIntent when you're ready to collect your customer's payment credentials.
Don't maintain long-lived, unconfirmed SetupIntents because they might not be valid.
The SetupIntent transitions through multiple [statuses](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/intents#intent-statuses) as it guides
you through the setup process.

Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future payments.
For example, cardholders in [certain regions](/guides/strong-customer-authentication) might need to be run through
[Strong Customer Authentication](https://stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication) during payment method collection
to streamline later [off-session payments](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/setup-intents).
If you use the SetupIntent with a [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#setup_intent_object-customer),
it automatically attaches the resulting payment method to that Customer after successful setup.
We recommend using SetupIntents or [setup_future_usage](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage) on
PaymentIntents to save payment methods to prevent saving invalid or unoptimized payment methods.

By using SetupIntents, you can reduce friction for your customers, even as regulations change over time.

  Secret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.

The primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can't view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.

All Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don't change per-user, like a third-party API key.

A `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.

  Events are our way of letting you know when something interesting happens in
your account. When an interesting event occurs, we create a new `Event`
object. For example, when a charge succeeds, we create a `charge.succeeded`
event, and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an
`invoice.payment_failed` event. Certain API requests might create multiple
events. For example, if you create a new subscription for a
customer, you receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a
`charge.succeeded` event.

Events occur when the state of another API resource changes. The event's data
field embeds the resource's state at the time of the change. For
example, a `charge.succeeded` event contains a charge, and an
`invoice.payment_failed` event contains an invoice.

As with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an
[individual event](https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_event) or a [list of events](https://stripe.com/docs/api#list_events)
from the API. We also have a separate
[webhooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) system for sending the
`Event` objects directly to an endpoint on your server. You can manage
webhooks in your
[account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks). Learn how
to [listen for events](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks)
so that your integration can automatically trigger reactions.

When using [Connect](https://stripe.com/docs/connect), you can also receive event notifications
that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there's an
additional `account` attribute in the received `Event` object.

We only guarantee access to events through the [Retrieve Event API](https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_event)
for 30 days.

  `ExchangeRate` objects allow you to determine the rates that Stripe is currently
using to convert from one currency to another. Since this number is variable
throughout the day, there are various reasons why you might want to know the current
rate (for example, to dynamically price an item for a user with a default
payment in a foreign currency).

Please refer to our [Exchange Rates API](https://stripe.com/docs/fx-rates) guide for more details.

*[Note: this integration path is supported but no longer recommended]* Additionally,
you can guarantee that a charge is made with an exchange rate that you expect is
current. To do so, you must pass in the exchange_rate to charges endpoints. If the
value is no longer up to date, the charge won't go through. Please refer to our
[Using with charges](https://stripe.com/docs/exchange-rates) guide for more details.

  A VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user.
The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options`
parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the

Each VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as
reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://stripe.com/docs/api/files)
API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the
[VerificationSession](https://stripe.com/docs/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.

  Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either
generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.

They contain [invoice items](https://stripe.com/docs/api#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments
that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).

If your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges,
Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note
that finalizing the invoice,
[when automatic](https://stripe.com/docs/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does
not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits
until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last
webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have
connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after
creation to finalize the invoice.

If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your
[email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic),
Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These
emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.

Stripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the
amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually
charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe's [minimum allowed charge
per currency](/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the
invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the
customer's credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.

More details on the customer's credit balance are
[here](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/customer/balance).

  Invoice Items represent the component lines of an [invoice](https://stripe.com/docs/api/invoices). An invoice item is added to an
invoice by creating or updating it with an `invoice` field, at which point it will be included as
[an invoice line item](https://stripe.com/docs/api/invoices/line_item) within
[invoice.lines](https://stripe.com/docs/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-lines).

Invoice Items can be created before you are ready to actually send the invoice. This can be particularly useful when combined
with a [subscription](https://stripe.com/docs/api/subscriptions). Sometimes you want to add a charge or credit to a customer, but actually charge
or credit the customer’s card only at the end of a regular billing cycle. This is useful for combining several charges
(to minimize per-transaction fees), or for having Stripe tabulate your usage-based billing totals.

  PaymentMethodConfigurations control which payment methods are displayed to your customers when you don't explicitly specify payment method types. You can have multiple configurations with different sets of payment methods for different scenarios.

There are two types of PaymentMethodConfigurations. Which is used depends on the [charge type](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/charges):

**Direct** configurations apply to payments created on your account, including Connect destination charges, Connect separate charges and transfers, and payments not involving Connect.

**Child** configurations apply to payments created on your connected accounts using direct charges, and charges with the on_behalf_of parameter.

Child configurations have a `parent` that sets default values and controls which settings connected accounts may override. You can specify a parent ID at payment time, and Stripe will automatically resolve the connected account’s associated child configuration. Parent configurations are [managed in the dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods/connected_accounts) and are not available in this API.

  You can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](https://stripe.com/docs/api#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.

Plans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products.
[Products](https://stripe.com/docs/api#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.

For example, you might have a single "gold" product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.

  Prices define the unit cost, currency, and (optional) billing cycle for both recurring and one-time purchases of products.
[Products](https://stripe.com/docs/api#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and prices help you track payment terms. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by prices. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.

For example, you might have a single "gold" product that has prices for $10/month, $100/year, and €9 once.

  A SetupIntent guides you through the process of setting up and saving a customer's payment credentials for future payments.
For example, you can use a SetupIntent to set up and save your customer's card without immediately collecting a payment.
Later, you can use [PaymentIntents](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intents) to drive the payment flow.

Create a SetupIntent when you're ready to collect your customer's payment credentials.
Don't maintain long-lived, unconfirmed SetupIntents because they might not be valid.
The SetupIntent transitions through multiple [statuses](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/intents#intent-statuses) as it guides
you through the setup process.

Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future payments.
For example, cardholders in [certain regions](/guides/strong-customer-authentication) might need to be run through
[Strong Customer Authentication](https://stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication) during payment method collection
to streamline later [off-session payments](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/setup-intents).
If you use the SetupIntent with a [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#setup_intent_object-customer),
it automatically attaches the resulting payment method to that Customer after successful setup.
We recommend using SetupIntents or [setup_future_usage](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage) on
PaymentIntents to save payment methods to prevent saving invalid or unoptimized payment methods.

By using SetupIntents, you can reduce friction for your customers, even as regulations change over time.

  Possible values are `incomplete`, `incomplete_expired`, `trialing`, `active`, `past_due`, `canceled`, `unpaid`, or `paused`. 

For `collection_method=charge_automatically` a subscription moves into `incomplete` if the initial payment attempt fails. A subscription in this status can only have metadata and default_source updated. Once the first invoice is paid, the subscription moves into an `active` status. If the first invoice is not paid within 23 hours, the subscription transitions to `incomplete_expired`. This is a terminal status, the open invoice will be voided and no further invoices will be generated. 

A subscription that is currently in a trial period is `trialing` and moves to `active` when the trial period is over. 

A subscription can only enter a `paused` status [when a trial ends without a payment method](/billing/subscriptions/trials#create-free-trials-without-payment). A `paused` subscription doesn't generate invoices and can be resumed after your customer adds their payment method. The `paused` status is different from [pausing collection](/billing/subscriptions/pause-payment), which still generates invoices and leaves the subscription's status unchanged. 

If subscription `collection_method=charge_automatically`, it becomes `past_due` when payment is required but cannot be paid (due to failed payment or awaiting additional user actions). Once Stripe has exhausted all payment retry attempts, the subscription will become `canceled` or `unpaid` (depending on your subscriptions settings). 

If subscription `collection_method=send_invoice` it becomes `past_due` when its invoice is not paid by the due date, and `canceled` or `unpaid` if it is still not paid by an additional deadline after that. Note that when a subscription has a status of `unpaid`, no subsequent invoices will be attempted (invoices will be created, but then immediately automatically closed). After receiving updated payment information from a customer, you may choose to reopen and pay their closed invoices.

  Tokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank
account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from
your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is
returned to your server to use. Use our
[recommended payments integrations](https://stripe.com/docs/payments) to perform this process
on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server,
and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.

If you can't use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using
the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If
your integration uses this method, you're responsible for any PCI compliance
that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with
client-side tokenization, your customer's information isn't sent directly to
Stripe, so we can't determine how it's handled or stored.

You can't store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account
information for later use, create [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#customers)
objects or [Custom accounts](https://stripe.com/docs/api#external_accounts).
[Radar](https://stripe.com/docs/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection,
performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.

  For bank accounts, possible values are `new`, `validated`, `verified`, `verification_failed`, or `errored`. A bank account that hasn't had any activity or validation performed is `new`. If Stripe can determine that the bank account exists, its status will be `validated`. Note that there often isn’t enough information to know (e.g., for smaller credit unions), and the validation is not always run. If customer bank account verification has succeeded, the bank account status will be `verified`. If the verification failed for any reason, such as microdeposit failure, the status will be `verification_failed`.

For external accounts, possible values are `new`, `errored` and `verification_failed`.

In the US and India, if we can't [verify the owner of the bank account](https://support.stripe.com/questions/bank-account-ownership-verification), we'll set the status to `verification_failed`.

  For bank accounts, possible values are `new`, `validated`, `verified`, `verification_failed`, or `errored`. A bank account that hasn't had any activity or validation performed is `new`. If Stripe can determine that the bank account exists, its status will be `validated`. Note that there often isn’t enough information to know (e.g., for smaller credit unions), and the validation is not always run. If customer bank account verification has succeeded, the bank account status will be `verified`. If the verification failed for any reason, such as microdeposit failure, the status will be `verification_failed`. If a payout sent to this bank account fails, we'll set the status to `errored` and will not continue to send [scheduled payouts](https://stripe.com/docs/payouts#payout-schedule) until the bank details are updated.

For external accounts, possible values are `new`, `errored` and `verification_failed`. If a payout fails, the status is set to `errored` and scheduled payouts are stopped until account details are updated. In the US and India, if we can't [verify the owner of the bank account](https://support.stripe.com/questions/bank-account-ownership-verification), we'll set the status to `verification_failed`. Other validations aren't run against external accounts because they're only used for payouts. This means the other statuses don't apply.
